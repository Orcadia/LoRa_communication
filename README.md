# LoRa communication
The aim of this project is to have two LoRa WiFi (V2) connected via LoRa protocol to send temperature and pressure data. Once the receiver have the datas they are send to a thingspeak channel.

All the datas in this project are simulated.

The message send over LoRa have a security key in order to not receive the datas from other devices that send datas over this protocol.
